# Chess API

The backend of my personal chess project. Routing is handled with FastAPI, and data handled with a combination of MySQL & pickle files.

## Docs

Head over to /docs to see the API documentation, which is autogenerated by FastAPI.

## Installation

Create and activate virtual environment. Although the version of Python should not be hugely important, development has testing have been done with Python 3.11.8. Some typehints may require Python 3.11.x

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

seed/reset the database (ensure the table exists and permissions granted)

```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [db_name] < app/db/ddl.sql
```

### Usage (for local testing)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Testing

```bash
pytest
```

### Deployment

- run me on port 5052 on the Pi
- TODO: add more deployment instructions
